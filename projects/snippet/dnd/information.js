Gadget's niece Penny and his dog Brain were taken to Dr. Claw's castle. Upon arrival, Augustin found Penny and Brain being tortured by Billy Thaw (Claw's nephew) and M.A.D Cat (Claw's cat) respectfully. With no time to spare, Gadget sprung into action - using his extendo-arms to rescue his family. His arms were suddenly sliced by a fiery magic blade wielded by George Claw himself. The pain from the slice would normally cause anyone to pass out from shock but Gadget instead stood their frozen in terror as he witnesses his arch-enemy's face for the first and last time."

As he opens the front doors, his eyes burn from the outdoor light. He sees Metro City but it's not the city he knows. It is much more than what he remembers. Hearing rushed footsteps behind him, he sprints to the local police building and charges in to ask for help. He quickly realizes that the place is abandoned, lights off, paper scattered and trash everywhere. The compounding confusion, anxiety and sadness sets in as he falls to his knees. Suddenly, he hears the distant echoing of Penny, giving him the attentiveness and curiosity he needs to keep going. He grabs some nearby clothes and presses on."
