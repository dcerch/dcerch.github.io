 ▌║█║▌│║▌│║▌║▌█║ Session 2 ▌│║▌║▌│║║▌█║▌║█

A few days after the infriltrating the Pyroguard Council and shooting money all over Smolder. Fire Nation proproganda spreads across the world about a terrorist group out of Smolder. Wanted posters, Newspapers, Ember scribes giving rally speeches in the streets. Metalbender comes in holding a newspaper to inform the group.

The Phoneix King predicted the events that would transpire. But how? PK was trying to extort the metal benders into more prod. so they would snap and attack the fire nation. Smolder starts to become a war zone, AA cannons, tanks, war balloons.

"Terrorists in Smolder Kill Innocent Children and Destory Local Business"

Just a few days ago was the Smolder's way of life distributed when savages began to take the lives of our fair citizens. Eye witness reports state that a small group of benders attacked an ember squad collections group, injurying and killing our loyal protectors. A long time running street vendor's life was also brutally taken away when caught in the crossfire of this attack. Not soon after these attacks did the terrorist group steal taxpayer tanks from an unidenfiable metal bending factory and assault the honorable Pyroguard Council. More Ember lives were lost while in the line of duty, horiffically impaled with stone spikes - killing three and leaving another permnantely disabled. Smolder's vault was also broken into and the money inside was taken, some of it even being shot into the sky. Due to these unfrounate events, the Pyrogruard Council will not have enough money to distribute back into the local businesses and will lead to even more people affected by this group's trail of blood.

It is without a doubt these thugs killed our people to profit on collections day. They knew that the vault would be holding most of Smolder's currency, selfishelly taking for themselves and shooting it out as a message of anarchy and unrest. These criminals must be found and tried for acts of war. If you have any information on this terrorist group (suspects, places of hiding, etc.), please inform your local Ember squad immediately. Any qualified leads will be heavily rewarded. We thank you for your dedication to protect the lives of not just your family and friends but also the nation as a whole.

 ▌║█║▌│║▌│║▌║▌█║ Session 3 ▌│║▌║▌│║║▌█║▌║█

The gang wake up to find Athari missing and a crowd of protestors and sympthaziers outside of Boomey's factory. Learning about the civil unrest, the group handles the situation peacefully but quickly finds themselves in a series of trying events. A boy with word from the Phenoix King himself rushes to Boomey with the news. The group learns they have the attention of the Supreme and Everlasting Fire Lord and are requested to travel to the main fire nation island.

A plan starts to form until Boomey decides to crack open the large metal black sphere. Turns out it was a concentrated and condensed form of fire... aka an experimental bomb. Michigan had great foresight to orgami a blast shield before the explosion, undoubetly saving the team from complete destruction. Reacting quickly, Shina borroughs through the floor and into the ground while Gon bends an unconcious Michigan with them and shields the hole from debris.

Boomey, understanding his mistake, valananetly tries to contain the energy ball. The force and heat from the explosion are almost too much to withstand but in a last ditch effort, boomey propels himself upward to silo the ball containing it enough for it not to destroy the nearby area. However, he doesn't land well and ends up knocking himself out. Shina, Gon and Michigan emerge from the ground and stablize Boomey. Realizing that the silo is uncapped and emitting energy still, Michigan and Gon team up to make it rain on the hotspot. It wasn't very effective. Shina absolutely destorys some nearby rocks into the finest sand the land has seen and fills the metal/stone cup, dampening most of the heat. Boomey tops it all off by metalbending some steel around the ball to contain its remaining energy.

Not soon after regaining their breath, Shina and Michigan see the silhoette of a massive dragon fly over head and Michigan puts forth is master plan to create a WMD in space, to which the group is not very receptive.

On the road to the Pyroguard Council where Athari is assumed to be held capative, the team propganda about terrorists in Smolder, wanted posters in their name and ember scribes giving rallying speeches. Michigan even reads a lengthy news article about how their group is being portrayed by the bad guys. Nevertheless, the group presses on and finds that the Pyroguard Council is a warzone. AA cannons, tanks, war balloons, hundreds of foot soliders cover the surrounding area.

The group infralitrate the Pyroguard Council underground and break into a prison where some civilians are detained. They mention that they overheard Arathi moving through the Pyroguard Council as a stop on the way to the capital city of the world. Boomey ushers the prisoners out and the gang recovene outside of the council grounds to discuss their next steps in their mission.

 ▌║█║▌│║▌│║▌║▌█║ Session 4 ▌│║▌║▌│║║▌█║▌║█

After careful dilberation, the gang decides to take Michigan's airship to his secret hideout to lay low for a while after causing such a scene in the city of Smolder. As the group departs the city, they spot multiple groups of ember squads bringing hundreds of civilians into the watch of the Pyroguard Council. Shina decides to help these citizens break free by dropping a boulder on them ember squad while flying away in the airship. With the help of Boomey, they crushed 18 civilians on their way out. Upon arriving to Michigan's hideout, they discover a blind and mute water bender from the Heated Springs tribe. She decides to join the group in their travels back to the tribe in hopes she would be reunited with her family.

In the early evening, the group decides to go by boat to Heated Springs due to the rumors of Fire Nation war balloons recently being spotted there. Gon experienced a heavy symptom of radiation poisoning while entering the boat and fell right off. This was the first wake up call to the group that there they are in some serious trouble. With the help of Michigan's blood test experiment, Gon was able to study the effects of radiation in blood, hoping that his forbidden blood bending would be a cure. Boomey finds comfort in the fact that this sickness would lead to super human ability.

Shortly after docking in the quiet lagoon of the Heated Springs, Gon is determined to get rid of this poision from his blood. The group agrees that they need to hunker down and give Gon time to work on his own body. As he begins to meditate and repair his cells, polar bears find their camp and attack; knocking out Michigan and tearing into Boomey. Thankfully with the help of Shina's offensive and defensive earth bending actions as well as Gon's water bending drowning ability, Boomey and Michigan survived the attack. Michigan and Shina decided to not repeat another surprise like they experienced and devised a thorough plan of scouting/alarm system.

As Gon progress in his testing, Boomey tries to mend the broken relationship that is him and Shina by providing her multiple gifts in the form of polar bear food, polar bear clothing, and a pebble-bound friendship braclet. It doesn't work. Michigan patrols the area for multiple hours 5 feet above the ground. Ally (Allie) begins to regain her water bending technique and performed some impressive water bending dancing that also helps commune with the water spirits. In her vision and with the help of Boomey's exceedingly clear understanding of her prophecy, she showed the group the necessity of caution when approaching the noises coming from the other side of the snow mounds lest they meet the Phenoix King earlier than they expected.

What will the gang do this time? Are they ready to take on what lies before them? Find out on this episode of World on Fire!

 ▌║█║▌│║▌│║▌║▌█║ Session 5 ▌│║▌║▌│║║▌█║▌║█

Prepared to see what's next, the group begins to travel up the snow mound to see what lies on the other side. However, before getting a chance to react, Boomey and Allie are surprised by a covered up trap hidden well under man-made plush snow. With the help of Gon, the rest of the group uncovers the trap and discovers the vertical drop of the tunnel. Michigan uses his origami paper to create a platform for the group to travel down, however, runs into a problem in the design that is increasing the air pressure, thereby halting the platform. In an attempt to fold parts of the origami, the pressure quickly releases. Michigan and Gon begin to free fall while Shina's quick thinking earth bending prevents the platform from slamming into the icy ground. At the bottom the group discovers that Boomey and Allie have been trapped, trying to figure out their next move. Shina spots a skeleton with ancient green glove with a gemstone which she wears and feels no different. Allie raises an ice platform to bring the group back to the surface.

Soon after seeing a private war balloon head into the Heated Springs town hurling flaming boulders and the battle intensifying, the group make a dash for town. Michigan struggles to know what the private war balloon's emblem is as it blares its ear deafening war horn. As the team sneak towards the ember squad from the private company, some of them trip and alert the nearby ember scribe to investigate while the ember squad waits to breach the Chieftain's house. Boomey immediately gets up and books it which alerts the scribe to the exact position. As Gon attempts to make the scribe trip on some ice, Michigan surprise mecha punches the scribe back, knocking him on his back while his helmet comes off. Michigan recognizes this as his older brother, Dallas, who is an ember scribe for his sister's regiment. Reunited but the brothers are not happy to see the other. Dallas calls his baby brother a traitor and a shame to the prestigious Galactus name. Michigan tries to convince his brother to call off the attack through words and his rifle but failed, causing his brother to consider him weak and walk back to his squad. Shina sees this as an opportunity to stick it to the fire nation by throwing a pebble at the brother's head. This action infuriates him, making him sprint towards the earth bender. Michigan, trying to keep the peace, restrains Shina in a paper cylinder which impresses his brother. Right before Dallas grabs Shina to execute, Michigan takes one final attempt to persuade his brother to stand down by providing him an interesting business opportunity to have the Galactus house overthrow the PK due to the PK's stretched military presence. Dallas agrees and calls off the attack.

As the private squad leaves, the Chieftain bursts out of the hut doors to defend the rest of his tribe. The group gets to the hut and discovers a bunch of women and children hiding in the hut, which includes a good portion of the town. Suddenly, the wind and noise from the war balloon can be felt as it travels back to Searing Pig. Shina eyes a flaming boulder but surprisingly does not feed to the emotion of anger and thereby does not hurl it at the war balloon. In the hut, Gon notices a few injured individuals and immediately tends to them. This attracts some nearby ladies and eventually wins over the crowd making them all feel safe while he is there. Meanwhile, Boomey sits in awe as the Chieftain and Allie work together to seamlessly take down the remaining fire nation. Boomey, Shina and Michigan assist the water tribe in defeating the fire nation. All of the townsfolk are brought back to Chieftain's hut and are cared for or buried. The Chieftain, old and ready to retire, relinquishs the role to his daughter, Allie in front of the masses. Allie has successfully restored her confidence in water bending and is ready to lead their tribe. She offers her help to the group in their conquest to take down the fire nation. Michigan provides Allie the design of his family's emblem and she agrees to fly it based on who is winning the war.

Boomey takes a heart felt moment to encourage Shina and that, with the power of friendship, nothing can stand in her way. With Heated Springs under their control, the group is becoming a sizable force to take on the Phoenix King and his shadow Pyroguard Council. Even with the fire nation spread thin, their ability to control the world remains strong. Can the group gather enough allies to take down the fire nation? Are they too late to take down the PK? What types of groups are puppeteering in the background? What is the cabbage production in Smolder now that it is a warzone? Find out more in this episode of World on Fire!

 ▌║█║▌│║▌│║▌║▌█║ Session 6 ▌│║▌║▌│║║▌█║▌║█

Soon after the rise of the water tribe in Heated Springs, the group ventures forth toward Igni: a land filled with volcanos and mountains and serving as the Fire Nation's main raw material gathering site. Michigan's creative mind decided to form a cyclone with his aerogami to swiftly bring the group to Igni from his secret hideout. However, due to this technique being new to him, he lost control as the group was on their way down to Igni. With some quick thinking from Shina, she pulled the lava from the volcano and created a slow ramp to keep the group from falling to their death. Michigan made it by unscathed as he has done in the past.

Upon inspection of Igni, the group realizes that there are multiple tunnels on the side of Igni that lead to various "resource centers" where lava is harvested and the rare materials are extracted, cooled and brought back for shipment. While in the hall entering one of these resource centers, Boomey tests how well an echo can reverberate and alerts the nearby fire nation soliders. However, he makes up for this by disguising the group in rock. The soliders weren't able to find them. Soon after, the group decides to sneak past the guards and make it into a nearby room. Only Shina and Michigan were successful with making it to the room where Michigan finds a golden book by wrecking the place. This leaves Gon and Boomey to fight the guards. They both took some major hits before Shina decides to come out and impale all three soliders with spikes from her armor. Killing two and leaving the other gravely wounded. Before being able to call for help, the solider was waterboarded, incapacitated, and healed enough so he can awaken to see his dead friends that he had known since he was a child. This torture pleases Gon. After being spat on and air sucked out of his lungs, the solider gives in and decides to tell the group everything they want to know. His name is George and he has a loving family. After seeing his family picture, Michigian realizes this man is a part of his family's private army. After some more torture, he decides to believe Michigian's story and agrees to help the group try to take control of Igni.

The group enters the main chamber of Igni, where there are many guards in formation with the labor master in the center behind a stone desk. Michigian convinces the labor master that he and the party are here on family business and has been sent to investigate the production in Igni. He also asks where Michigan's sister (Brooklyn) is stationed to which it is revealed she is most likely in Smolder. Before they are free to go, the labor master eyes Boomey and questions where he has heard that name and has seen his face. Boomey deflects by causing all of the nearby guards to fall into a hole, impressing the labor master and providing him a strange gift. A small white coin. The labor master ushers the group out of Igni, leaving it still under control by the fire nation.

As the group thinks about where to go next, a old woman wheeling a cart full goods approaches Igni. She smiles as she passes and causes Boomey's coin and Shina's glove to pulse and itch a white lotus flower on them. This causes the group to ask the woman more questions, to which she has no answers. Before hope is lost, Boomey utters the words "White Lotus" causing blueish-white light to burst from her eyes in both, spawning a projection of Avatar Kyoshi (kee-yoshi) and Prince Zuko to Shina and Boomey respectively. Michigan and Gon do not see these visions. Boomey, seeing the vision of his sensei, is baffled and begins asking him questions about his path. Zuko refers to Boomey as Apooa and reveals that Apooa is on his path. Finding the white lotus and the spirit of Zuko by the power found within him and his friends. Shina, seeing the vision of her teacher, is less baffled and more convicted to ask Kyoshi what she should do next to find her path. She reveals that her goal to kill Arthari or seek vengenence on the Fire nation will not provide her with the comfort she so desires. Her true power will come in the form of inner peace. She also mentions that her success relies on the success of Boomey. Their paths are entangled.

As the visions fade and the old woman falls, the group takes a moment to catch up on what just happened. Shina reveals to the woman that she was just a vessel to speak to spirits, which causes the woman to freak out a little bit and be on her way. As Shina runs after the woman, Boomey meditates and communes with the spirits once more. He asks one of the several spirits flying around for help on his path. This spirit reveals to Boomey that perhaps the shadow council may know of the White Lotus and where to find them. Before being able to leave, the spirit is attacked by an evil spirit. After Boomey ends his meditation, a rift in the sky opens up where spirits flood out and circle in the air, visible to everyone. Due to the imbalance of the two worlds, the thin veil of realities cross with even small activities such as spirit meditation. A good and evil bear spirit fall from the sky, grappling it's counterpart. The group frantically tries to speak to the spirits but they are uninterested. Only until Michigian reveals his golden book, do they pay any attention to the party. Shina, using her glowing glove is able to touch the spirit as if it is physically there. Finally, Boomey reveals the coin to the spirits and they begin form into one complete spirit. The bear spirit nuzzles its head into Shina's glove and hops away content.

Not soon after the bear leaves, the sky turns grey. Heavy clouds start to shadow the area. Michigan feels an electrical discharge in the air. The party begins to see hundreds of figures in black robes making their way toward Igni. Not keen on sticking around, Michigan wind teleports the group back to his nearby hideout successfully. As they are leaving, the clouds and spirits disperse. Michigan makes hot coco for everyone and begins to cross reference his book to the golden book.

4 ARTIFACTS OF WHITE LOTUS
--------------------------

GOLDEN BOOK
- Theories on how to attack (damaging) or remove (sucking in) spirits from the spirit world through spirit shards. The Mystic Arts of Ether confirm this theory with rhetoric around being able to remove spirits from the world.
- This book was passed down by generation to generation by the group who killed the air benders. It was in the possession of the captain guard of Igni.

GLOVE
- Allows physical touch with the spirits
- Owned by the right hand man of Kyoshi, primary responsibility was handling any spirits (lost, agressive, etc)

COIN
- Binds broken spirits back together
- Igni labor master was instructed to give the coin to the pupil of Zuko

SPECTRE STAFF
- Water bending technique to remove spirit from physical bodies
- Used by water tribe white lotus member to heal a mortal body's spirit

OTHER NOTES
-----------
Vaatu is the dark spirit (living and empowering Fire Lord)
Raava is the light spirit

 ▌║█║▌│║▌│║▌║▌█║ Session 7 ▌│║▌║▌│║║▌█║▌║█

After a good night's sleep and some hot coco, the group deliberates on what to do next. As they were chatting, Gon, with his all-seeing eyes, spots a dark and light cat in the hideout. The spirits begin to fight but Shina quickly grabs the dark spirit cat by the scruff and Boomey uses the coin to fuse them. Thankful for their help, the cat agrees to guide them to the white lotus. Their first stop: the spectre staff, locked up in the ruins of an air temple. They encountered the black robe figures, dark spirit birds and a giant harpoon ballista on the way to the temple. Even with the boulder deflection from Shina and evasive maeneuvr from Michigan, the harpoon damages the balloon and the ship sinks, heading into the deep valleys of the island. Boomey and Shina were successful in creating a ramp to slow the airship down. At the bottom of the valley, the Boomey and Shina help the group traverse the terrain to make it to the air temple.

After making it to the temple doors, the group is met with their first puzzle. Thankfully, Gon recounts from his days serving the Fire nation that the door only opens with fire bending. Boomey comes up with the clever idea to create a bonfire oven and have Michigan air bending fire into the door. The door slams open. The next challenge they face is the three doors in the interior of the tower. The cat accidentally triggers the white lotus symbol in the middle of the room to which Shina utters the words, causing the left room's door to open. A spirit beast rushes out and goes to attack Boomey. Michigan attempts to use his ghostbusting technique for the first time but fails. The group is saved when Shina is able to incapsulate the beast in a glove infused spherical jail, allowing the group time to search around. After many failed investigation rolls, Shina discovers a hidden button which opens the next room door. Boomey had started the spirit fusion process so the light spirit gets combined into it's dark spirit inside the ball. The group goes into the next room and discovers it to be a water bending puzzle. After some concentrated water bending, Gon unlocks the final room, which is spotted to be trapped. Naturally, Boomey tests this with a rock and finds that it is indeed trapped. Michigan folds his aerogamy into a butterfly to flutter into the room to grab the staff sitting on the altar but knocks it to the ground. Luckily, he was able to shamelessly slutter around the altar to get it out safely.

The staff responds to Gon's prescence, glowing with the white lotus symbol when in his possession, making him it's true owner. Not shortly after getting the staff, the group hears a fire nation airship and solider footsteps approaching. Boomey releases the trapped beast spirit and the group make their way up the stairs to the top of the broken tower. On the way up, Shina tries to throw the broken stone sphere but it doesn't hit the approaching soldiers. On the roof, the group sees the airship with multiple fire nation on board. Michigan wind tunnels the two visible soliders off but one of them falls forward in front of Gon, breaking both of his legs. Shina and Boomey worked together to catapult everyone on board. Gon swings his new staff into the head of the solider grabbing him by the ankle and causes the soldier's spirit to seperated and fall through the ship due to Gon's downward swing. After seeing the horror that Gon has done to his crewmate, the pilot attempts to tilt the entire airship sideways to throw everyone off and ends up throwing off all of his soliders and Boomey. Thinking quickly, Shina catches Boomey with a stone platform and allows him to survive the couple hundred foot drop. Boomey confidentally uses stone pillars to jump back up from the depths of the valley back onto the ship. Michigan removes the silly pilot the ship by wind tunneling him off as well.

Michigan begins to pilot the airship in the direction of Searing Pig. On their way there, Gon seperates Boomey's spirit from his body in an attempt to communicate with the cat. The cat reveals that there have been rumors that the white lotus has popped up in Searing Pig, that the black robe figures are from a dangerous group called the Infernal Dynasty and that Shina is a desendent of Kyoshi herself. The fate of the physical and spirit worlds lie heavy on this group. Can the group traverse the political landscape of Searing Pig? Will the Galactus family finally see their son after so many years? How many souls will Gon rip from their bodies before the end of this campaign? You decide in this session of World on Fire!

 ▌║█║▌│║▌│║▌║▌█║ Session 8 ▌│║▌║▌│║║▌█║▌║█
 
On the way to Searing Pig, the group decides to land to visit the Galactus family to find more on the White Lotus. Upon landing, the inspector begins to question why different tribes are on a fire nation war balloon. Michigan fails to convince the inspector that he is a part of the royal family, to which the local army guards approach. Boomey steps up and mentions that they are here on the basis that he is the manufacturer of these parts but that alone is not enough to sway the guards perspective. In a moment of fustration, Shina restrains two of the four guards in order for them to listen to reason. However, they see it as an attack and a fight breaks out. During the fight, Shina punches molten rock at one of the guards, which ends up melting through his armor and flesh. The fire nation is terrified by this sight and begin to panic or scatter. In an effort to put the guard out of his misery as lava eats away at his insides, Gon knocks the withered spirit out of him. However, Michigan for some reason sucks in the spirit to make sure his new ghost busting technique works and then proceeds to also suck the air out of the remaining guards so they don't have to witness anymore of this bruality. The inspector breaks down and cries, never seeing this kind of torture in his life. Gon collects his tears as they flow and fills his container. As the group talks about what to do next, the inspector finally believes that Michigan is a part of the family. He tells the group that the royal family has been kidnapped that same morning, the day of the triple F (fire feast festival) and requests the remaining private army allows them passage to the castle.

Upon entering the castle, the group is greeted by Ralph, the longstanding ember scribe dedicated to the Galactus family. He claims to have known Michigan since he was a kid and annoints him as a temporary acting king. Ralph confirms the truth that the family was kidnapped and suspects the Brimstone family is to blame. He questions how they would know their current estate affairs that most of their military is overseas, attributing it to an internal mole. He then offers the group some hearty food and tea as well as ordering the private investigation unit to find out more about this mole. Michigan, knowing how his family operates, warns the group that the food or tea could be poisoned. Gon confirms this by extracting the poison from the tea. Another servant brings out cake and slices it for the group. Michigan questions the servant and request that he taste some or bring it back to the chef to taste. As the servant leaves, Gon pretends to slip and crashes in the cake. The servants rush in and apologize for not doing their due diligence and begin to clean the area. Michigan decides to take a look around for signs of his parents after overhearing one of the servants mentioning they being back soon. (BTW META: most of the staff were told that they family were simply out and about for FFF in order to keep their kidnapping a secret for reputation purposes.) As Michigan leaves, the door to the room the rest of the group is in, closes and locks. Boomey breaks the lock easily and they begin to investigate who is trying to lock them in.

They narrow their suspicions to it being someone in the house, mentioning it to Ralph. After some keen insight from Shina while holding Ralph upside down, he is proven to be a liar and admits that he wants to keep the prince safe from the rest of the group because, as Boomey would say, he is a racist but also because what he witnessed on the landing pad earlier. As Ralph talks to Michigan, he recounts that there was a Brimstone lawyer that entered the Galactus family grounds to negotitate the terms of the festival. That lawyer was one of the last individuals to have interacted with the family and should probably be found to interogate. Michigan orders the private army to approach the Brimstone family from the front, while the group does recon in the back. Ralph agrees and provides the group peasantry attair suited to blend in to the Brimstone landscape.

After the group lands and sweeps the area, they find a small metal hut with a sign that says, "Brimstone Legal". The group peacefully enters the lawyer's house as they want to purchase a plot of land. Michigan uses cleverly disguised language to gather enough information as to where his family is most likely kept. They grab the deed to the land next to a plot with a cave. The lawyer is a simple man and only wants to do his deeds, unknowing the groups intentions. 

In the open field of the land they own, the group begin to scout out the cave. Approaching from the back and sensing the people inside. Boomey senses over 20 people, 3 of them lying on the ground. The group deliberate on what to do and decide on Boomey digging under the cave and peeking inside. As Boomey begins to clear the ground to peek out, he's greeted with a peasant man look down directly at him. Boomey scambles on what to say and just says he has information to pass along. The peasant is confused and kicks Boomey in the face. Boomey didn't take kindly to that and rips the guy into the ground and drags him to the group. As the group asks him questions, the peasant whistles for his buddies but Michigan's quick thinking is able to dampen the noise through air bending. With no other options, the peasant decides to help the group but for a price. The group scronges up 1000 gold from the balloon and offers 750 to the peasant. Looking to sweeten the deal, the peasant asks for more but the group denies him. He gets up and begins to go to the cave to convince the group to let the prisoners free. Shina overhears the peasant talk about betraying the group and sees him and the guards outside begin to move in to warn the others. Boomey and Shina work together to completely seal offer the cave entrance. At the same time, Gon freezes one guard in place as Michigan shoots off the leg of the peasant; the remaining guard is put into a stone sphere jail. Being the good guy that he is, Gon then blood bends the peasant's leg back together, almost as if it were never blown off. Michigan leaves the peasant 50 gold and sucks the air out of all the Brimstones outside.

Boomey digs into the cave, grabs the 3 people lying down and brings them outside. After unveiling their masks, Michigan's parents and brother are identified. Shocked to see his long exiled son, Denver requests to have a conversation back at the family grounds. Michigan's father, Denver, publically announces his apperciation for Michigan and the group saving the royal family. However, he does not forget the dishonor that Michigan has brought and keeps his offical decree that Michigan is no longer a Galactus. As the group begins to question his decision, Michigan's mother, Alaska, forces her husband's hand to provide a pardon to their son after what he has done to save the family at this moment. Denver begrudgingly agrees. As the group celebrates, Dallas mentions to Michigan that his original plan does not sit well with father. Before leaving, Shina asks the million dollar question of information on the White Lotus and also reveals that they have a spirit that have lead them to Searing Pig. The spirit cat enters the building and is immediately recognized by Alaska and is revealed that it is Whisker's the family cat. Denver speaks privately to the group, stating to the group that the prophecy is true and that they are on the correct path. He would've never imagined that his son would be walking this path and understands that fate called Michigan to leave and pursue this path. He takes the group to the master bedroom, opens a trap door underneath the bed and leads the group down to an unidentified room.

How does Denver know of the White Lotus? What is the White Lotus Prophecy? How many spirits need to be sucked, tears collected, or people brutually murdered for Boomey to abandon the group? Find out more on this episode of World on Fire!

 ▌║█║▌│║▌│║▌║▌█║ Session 9 ▌│║▌║▌│║║▌█║▌║█

As the group looks around the basic stone room, Denver explains the White Lotus history and its prophecy, which outlines the destruction of the planet. Boomey begins to sense the rumbling of several hundred bare footsteps coming from inside the castle. Denver goes to leave to protect his family but requests his son Michigan to sign the book and lead the White Lotus group before leaving. Michigan refuses given his free spirit. As Denver goes to leave, Boomey breaks the mechanism to the hidden room, causing the bed to fall and seal them in. Desperately trying to lift, Denver is not successful in opening the secret entrance as he hears the screaming of people being murdered. With some help from Michigan's wind gust, the bed is propelled upwards, only to reveal several Brimstone boys going in for an attack. The boys dive towards Denver and Michigan but the fates have decided that they will fall down the stairs instead, where Boomey, Shina and Gon are. Boomey and Shina work together to jail these rascals and inteograte them. Shina discovers they are dimwits and cannot be reasoned with. They have been commanded to find and murder the Galactus family but the binds that Shina restrains with them further will ensure that won't happen for these guys. Gon decides to help Michigan and Denver fend off any other attackers. In a stroke of genius, Gon ices the floor at the top of the stairs and Michigan uses wind to have another set of Brimstone boys fall down the stairs onto ice spikes. Shina and Boomey grab the book and pen and begin to regroup. Another group of boys dive down, two of them brutually impaling their jugulars on more spikes. Gon gives them the heads up that there's some more blood coming down their way. However, one of the boys does manage to sink his dagger into the chest of Denver. Michigan swiftly uses his fans to cut the neck of the striker (providing more blood for blood god) as well as covering the opening to the entrance with his aerogamy. Gon analyzes the current condition of Denver and finds that that the dagger was poisoned blood bends him back to health.

Reaching the top of the stairs, the group leaves the bedroom to find hundreds upon hundreds of Brimstone boys inside and outside the castle - with a good portion of them being naked. Denver mentions that the kitchen contains the secret passage that potentially the Galactus family and staff would escape to. As the Brimstones climb the stairs to attack the group. Boomey carves a stone platform down to drop the group closer to the kitchen area, crushing multiple brimstones. Standing face to face with hundreds of Brimstones in front of them, Gon ices the surrounding area and Shina builds a stone barrier to give them some time. Denver requests that the earth benders break the wall behind them to get into the kitchen.

Upon entering the kitchen, the group immediately notices 4 Brimstones holding down a goliath with a muzzle mask. As Denver goes to the corner to hide, Boomey opens the fight with tossing the surrounding kitchenware at goliath and friends. Impailing the goliath with a knife and knocking two brimstones off balance. Michigan flies to the rafters, pulls out his gun and aims. Shina attempts restrain the goliath and friends but it isn't terribly effective. Gon attempts to drown the goliath but ends up hydrating him. Growing restless, the goliath breaks a couple of the binds of his captors, crushing one of them into the wall. Seeing this the group begins to kill off the Brimstone boys or break the ropes that are keeping this beast contained. Gon notably drowned one of the Brimstone boys then froze the water around his head and in his body, causing him to have the most excruciating, painful death anyone has ever experienced. After being set free, the goliath rips off his mask and guns it towards Shina while she waits for him with open arms. The goliath reaches Shina and picks her up with two arms and begins to squeeze her, seemingly like he is crushing her. Michigan swoops down to break Shina free put misses completely while Boomey and Gon get into flanking position. Boomey sharpens a piece of metal table and slices the goliath arm, almost completely off. The goliath drops Shina in agony. Shina and Boomey work together to inprision the goliath in layers of stone and steel, containing the beast. Michigan scours the room for the secret door, spots it and begins to solve the puzzle that would open the door. Gon runs over to assist with opening this secret door. As Shina concentrates on holding the goliath inside, he punches through the barrier, causing a sizable hole to open. He screams at both Boomey and Shina that he is no slave. Boomey attempts to reason with the goliath about how they are not out to harm them but the goliath sees through his deceit since he was harmed. Boomey runs off to the secret passage that was recently opened, leaving Shina to defend herself against this foe. Shina attempts to reason with the goliath but he is also not convinced. In a last ditch attempt, she drops her prison, allowing him to go free. He nods and rushes off to bust through the wall the group came through, barreling through and crushing many Brimstones on the way out.

The group reaches a door at the end of the secret passage. Boomey senses people inside and decides to knock. Hearing the voice of Alaska, Michigan speaks up and the door begins to unlock and open. In the room are three people: Alaska, a servant and a random person (that no one questioned). Denver and Alaska embrace, thinking they would never see each other again. Alaska gives the group the sad news that Dallas didn't make it out alive. The group begin talking about the White Lotus and Denver tries to get them to be quiet. Alaska overhears the group talk about the White Lotus and how it may have led to Dallas' death. Denver attempts to explain but Alaska, being fustrated and angry, doesn't want to hear any of it. Shina attempts to reason with Alaska but Alaska's limited family-centric world view does not allow her to understand the significance of the White Lotus group. Shina pushes back and asks the question as to how Dallas died. She recounts the horrific images she was forced to watch which was Dallas' insides being gutted and used to strangle him. While emotions run high, Michigan mentions the group should leave due to the immediate danger. Boomey suggests that him and Shina collapse the castle and kill as many Brimstones as possible. The group agrees and head out. From a safe nearby location, Shina and Boomey begin to demolish the castle while everyone watches. Painful screams from both brimstone boys and goliaths are heard off in the distance. Seeing the destruction unfold in front of them, any remaining brimstones attempt to flee back to their homeland. Shina takes one of the collapsing bolders and tosses it down the airstrip, killing 50 people. As they scatter, a lone goliath with a cut arm is seen waving down the airships as they fly away.

Denver and Alaska go off to seek aid from the Disco ladies, the only allies they have left. Michigan warns his father not to eat too many apple pies, like he did last time. To which Alaska remarks, "I'll make sure of that" in a somber tone. As they depart and Michigan's repairs his aerogamy airship, Boomey and Shina decide to take a look at the book that started this chaos. Shina finds a torn page at the end of the book. Thinking there's more to this, Boomey gathers the group to wave their artifacts around the pages of the book, revealing hidden ancient texts that the group can't decipher. Michigan has the bright idea to decrypt the tome by searching for references in the Torchlight Vault - a place he hadn't been in some time. The group sets sail for the Torchlight Vault, unaware of the dangers that are there.

Will the group decipher the anicent texts to put a stop to the prophecy? Will anyone ever understand Shina? How will Gon satisfy his BDSM tendencies? How much sucking will Michigan do? Why hasn't Boomey left yet? Find out on this final episode of World on Fire!


PROPHECY FORETOLD
600 years after the exinction of the air tribe, a great comet will be brought to our planet. Shadowy forces beyond comprehension will aid the fire nation in seizing control of each tribe in exchange for assistance in pulling the comet to the planet. It is said that the fire from the comet will bring about overwhelming heat, ending all life besides the strong fire benders.

The secret society of the White Lotus group must be led by trusted fire nation elites in order to validate the legitmacy of this prophecy. Each generation of leaders will sign their name as a commitment to thwart, undermine, delay, or in any way prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled. If and when the time comes, the avatar will be the only person capable of saving all of us.

As it is written, it shall be done.
