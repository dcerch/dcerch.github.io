    backstory:
    '<p>The eco-terrorist group Avalanche, in an attempt to save the Planet from the corrupting ways of Shinra, attacks the reactor. The effort is led by Barret Wallace who is accompanied by Biggs, Wedge, Jessie, and the recently hired mercenary Cloud Strife. The team captures a train and uses it to break into the reactor grounds, which are defended by Shinra guards.</p>' +
    '<p>The team fights its way down into the main generator, and prepares to put the charges in. Cloud has a brief flashback to the incident in Nibelheim and suffers a psychic disturbance. Before the charges can be pulled, the robot Guard Scorpion attacks, and is defeated by Cloud and Barret before they and the rest to Avalanche make their way back out before the reactor explodes.</p><p>The explosion causes massive destruction with unknown numbers of civilian casualties. Cloud and Avalanche scatter to regroup at the train heading for the Sector 7 slums.</p>' +

      '<p>The adventure follows the perspective of the trio and Don when they first encounter Cloud and Aerith. Soon after Cloud and Aerith\'s request to enter into the Don\'s bride showcase, Shinra\'s head of public safety (Heidegger) soon catches wind of this and leads a full on assault of Wall Market to take down AVALANCHE. After several failed attempts to apprehend Cloud and team, Heidegger locks down the entrance to the Wall Market through Sector 6 and floods the sewers then proceeds to lay seige to the marketplace. This act is pinned as a war for the safety of Shinra\'s upstanding citizens who live both in the slums and upper sectors of Midgar. It is up to the Don and his "trusty" trio to defend their home or be left in the rubble.</p>' +

    '<p>After conquering the world, the fire nation imprisoned elite benders of Earth and Water and killed the remaining benders who would not comply or were deemed unnecessary. With the destruction of Aang and the air temples, the practice of air bending was snuffed out. Bending of any element is strictly forbidden unless otherwise approved by the fire nation. The only exceptions to this rule is fire nation military or enslaved benders such as Earth for city-building or Water for medics.</p>' +
    '<p>Technology has advanced significantly due to executive orders from the fire nation to contract/build military grade warfare as well as specialized bending techniques like metal and lightning bending. This effectively brought the entire world into an industrial/steampunk age. Cities are monitored and laws are enforced by ruthless military squads called embers. Ember squads sometimes are accompanied by heavy machinery such as tanks or cannons.</p>' +
    '<p>In this authoritarian, police-state like society, all business profit is forfeited to the fire nation at the start of every month. At the end of each month, businesses are then provided a discretionary amount of money by an anonymous fire nation owned group, typically disclosing just enough money for the business to stay afloat. Unfortunately, living outside of a fire nation established society means dealing with rage filled spirits that roam the land; presenting a constant threat to outsiders survival.</p>' +

    '<p>We open in the fire nation controlled land of Smolder, a previously thriving Earth Kingdom city (Boulder). Originally, this city was known to be a safe haven for refugees and highly profitable. With massive walls, free/open/fair trade practices and market days, anyone could start a business and thrive with relative ease. The city has changed much since its glory days. Production of the city was switched to gathering and manufacturing of metal, making it the largest producer of steel plates, piping, and other metal related industrial components. Enslaved metal-benders work endlessly to pull, heat and shape the metal while supervised by ember squads.</p>' +
    '<p>It is currently a late spring morning when several additional ember squads are seen entering the city. It is collections day, where the fire nation collections/extorts all local business profits. However, there are more squads than normal. Rumor has it that there are special orders from the Phoenix King to increase production of the city by any means necessary. Yelling, threats, violence can be seen and heard all over the city - street vendors, factory workers, residents.</p>' +
    '<h4>Vendor Scene</h4><p>Most local vendors cower when ember patrols stop by their shop. They never know how collections will go. For some vendors, collections may even cost them their life. Smarter vendors bargain with information about wealthy travelers or resistance groups in exchange to keep a portion of their profits.</p>' +
    '<h4>Factory Scene</h4><p>Enslaved metal-benders are given the orders to increase productivity but are vocal about not being able to do so. With every ore dug, it becomes more and more difficult to go deeper and pull more. After a few violent brainstorming sessions, one enslaved metal-bender speaks up to explore the volcano outside of the city since there is a high potential for easy to gather ore.</p>' +
    '<h4>Resident Scene</h4><p>On particularly bad collection days, fights between resistance groups or fed-up civilians and the ember squads are numerous; leading to the destruction of property such as houses or land and the deaths of families.</p>' +

This dangerous form of bending is difficult to master, needing extreme focus and discipline. At an early age, Shina was exiled by her family for being a rebel - never letting inhumane activity go unnoticed. No longer in the safety of the city walls, she sought shelter in a nearby cave where she had to fend for herself. Unbeknownst to her, badger moles also inhabited the cave. Luckily, these moles were friendly and raised her as their own. One fateful night, a group of evil spirits entered her cave and terrorized her thoughts - causing her to flee as far away from the spirits. On the brink of a mental collapse, she ended up near on the ledge of volcano mouth where the spirits were coercing her to jump. She lifts her arms high in one final moment of surrender and sees a vision of Kyoshi. Bursting out of the volcano comes a fury of molten rock, emulsifing the spirits right where they were, casted as statues of their ethereal self. From that moment on, she swore to become powerful enough to take back these lands from the demons and fire nation alike. Currently, Shina lives in the same volcano near Smolder.',

    backstory:
    '<p>Perilous descent into madness, dealing with a prodigious number of threats to body and mind! Five hundred feet below the earth you will not only fight unimaginable foes, but famine, disease, and the stress of the ever-encroaching dark. This story is driven by a set of 9 predefined classes that can be chosen by players.</p>' +
    '<h3>Setting</h3>' +
    '<p>Dark Gothic setting and atmosphere. Corruption and monsters have escaped the forgotten darkness of the deep and have overrun the once idyllic estate of the players late ancestor, a scion of an ancient noble family. As if being plagued by disease and misery wasn\'t enough, the people of the impoverished Hamlet must now withstand unthinkable nightmares roaming the land. The cause of this evil was the ancestor himself, who meddled with dark forces in pursuit of immortality after a lifetime of perverse debauchery and unsealed a nightmarish power entombed far below his mansion. At last appalled by his actions and repentant, the ancestor has ended his own life and bequeathed the Estate to the player, urging that they purge it of the slavering horrors that now roam freely.</p>' +
    '<h3>Special Rules</h3>' +
    '<h4>Stress Meter</h4>' +
    '<p>In addition to normal health and mana pools, each player character has a stress meter. When a horrific event happens, an enemy uses a stress ability, or critically hits the player character, stress damage will be dealt. Certain player characters may be more or less susceptible to stress damage. When a character reaches their stress threshold, they will experience a negative attribute based on their class (which is referenced in the "Personality/Psyche" link for each character sheet).</p>' +
    '<h4>Light Meter</h4>' +
    '<p>While exploring the Ruins, Warrens, Weald or Cove, light from torches will diminish and darkness will over take the party. Every turn in darkness (10 seconds) inflicts 10 stress damage.</p>' +
    '<h4>Hunger</h4>' +
    '<p>During certain intervals, hunger checks will be announced. There is no option to delay or skip this check. If the player character has food, they can take the action to eat and regain 10 health. If they do not have food, they will take 20% of the maximum health as damage and 10 stress damage.</p>' +

However, if his own solace be paramount, the protection and prison of his mask may be slipped — a calming intoxication of air upon a striken visage. While looking upon such maligned flesh may revolt those he shares the firelight with, true companionship he can always find, meditating on his lofty blade — a once officious weapon, now broken as the man who wields it.</p><p>In the end, all will meet with death.

With his lute he can provide in-battle comfort for his companions, playing songs that inspire greatness or relieve tension. His merry tunes are best in the back row however if he gets shuffled to the front his blades can do serious damage.

The melodious riffs of his lute will make any party member\'s mind quiet as he encourages them to strike quickly and precisely like a tiger.

While he can no longer swing his great mace with the force he once could, you should not stand where he swings his mighty weapon. However it is not offense, but his defense, that makes the Man-at-Arms such a vital member of any team. His ability to read the enemy\'s movements allows him to draw fire to himself to defend his allies and then retaliate with surprising force.</p><p>The battlefield is a chaotic place, and the Man-at-Arms knows how to make himself heard. With his vociferous shouting he can issue vital commands to his men or let out a terrible bellow to strike fear into the enemy\'s heart. At camp, the Man-at-Arms can take time to instruct and practice with others, giving efficient information and life saving instruction.

      '<p>This story is played out completely ad-hoc since it is highly dependent on the player characters in the story.</p>' +
      '<h3>Special Events</h3>' +
      '<h4>Calling Lights</h4><p>The sunlight begins to pull and concentrate in certain areas of the world. After 5 minutes, the contrast between lit areas and darkness becomes stark. The beams begin to rapidy heat up the areas where they are shining. Completely dark areas have voices that can be heard spewing madness and beckoning for each player character\'s comfort. Each player must make a 18 CHA saving throw or call out for what gives them comfort. If the former fails, the player character moves 15 feet toward the darkness. If the latter, an apparition of that comfort comes from the darkness, only visible to that player, and is immediately hostile.</p>' +
      '<h4>Lord of Clarity</h4><p>Ghosts of citizens haunt the village but remain neutral, performing the tasks they normally would if they were alive. Each citizen has a piece of their soul that was taken from them, keeping them as servants of their ghost lord. Lord is keeping part of their souls since he feels bad for the burden they carry. Killing the ghost lord will return the pieces of their soul back to them so they can finally rest. Alternatively, each citizen can be made aware of that piece that is missing and that part of them can be returned through a ritual. The following are the pieces: every day fear of being murdered, parent denial that child died from a shipwreck, sadness of fighting a deadly disease.</p>' +
      '<h4>Poet\'s Heart</h4><p>Random encounter with a ragged bard, singing the following song: "Now that she\'s back in the atmosphere. With drops of Jupiter in her hair. She acts like summer and walks like rain. Reminds me that there\'s a time to change, hey. Since the return of her stay on the moon. She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey. Hey, hey-yeah." He may stop and ask the group if they know who his heart speaks of. If they guess incorrectly, he\'s gets absurdly upset and hostile toward the group. If they guess right, he awards them with a magical lute that can cause hostile enemies to become neutral for a turn.</p>' +
      '<h4>Death\'s Door</h4><p>When exploring the upper rafts of the castle, there is a rigged chest. When opening the chest without inspection, the player character requires a 19 DEX saving throw to avoid breathing in a toxic fume that comes out. If affected, the player character immediately loses vision of their reality and sees an entire world full of red (fire, lava, brimstone, etc). Demons flying around the castle take notice of the player character in this world and turn hostile toward the player character. Each hit can be avoided by a 10 CHA saving throw. If hit 3 times, player character moves toward the castle edge and jumps off.</p>' +
      '<h4>Drunken Angel</h4><p>When entering the dining area of the castle, the doors close and lock. Golden chalices of infinite wine lift up and attempt to be poured into the mouths of the player characters. If wine reaches the mouth, the player characters immediately feel drunk and high. Player characters gain CHA +5, INT -5, immunity to mind affects, have a slight golden glow, wings burst from their backs allowing them to fly (albeit poorly), demons have combat advantage on affected player characters.</p>' +
      '<h4>The Kill</h4><p>When the player characters sleeps for the first time, their dreams are nightmares. Each player character is randomly split amongst two opposing nations in the midst of a battle. There are hundreds of soldiers attacking each other, each player character is "attacked" by a random soldier but it is the player characters attacking each other. Player character\'s stats are kept in the dream state. When one player character receives fatal damage, both identities are revealed. The feeling of remorse and shame befalls the victor while the feeling of hopelessness and brokeness befalls the defeated. When waking up, victorious player characters gain STR +5, DEX +5, and disadvantage on mental checks. The defeated player characters only have 1 death saving roll.</p>',
